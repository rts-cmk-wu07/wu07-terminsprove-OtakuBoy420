# Trainer app

Welcome to my trainer app repository! :)

# Description

This repository is a trainer mobile web-app that uses the [Trainer API](https://github.com/OtakuBoy420/trainer-api) as backend.

<br>

# Approach

## MVP

Minimal Viable Product

- User can login and logout
- User can see a list of classes
- User can join and leave a class
- If user isn't logged in, they can't see the schedule or join a class

## Should have

- User can see a schedule with all the classes they are attending
- User can view details about a class by pressing it
- Search for classes and trainers
- User can navigate trough the app
- The styling should look somewhat like the design given

## Nice to have

- Design and animations should make the app feel alive and fun to use
- Welcome screen
- User can rate a class from 1-5
- Animated routes
- Triangle icon in header filter by rating
- The app should look either exactly like the design given or really close

# Front-end Stack

## Framework: React

<br>

## Libraries:

## TailwindCSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed CSS classes that make it easy to style your HTML elements. The reason i choose to use TailwindCSS instead of other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap is because i have a lot of experience with it and it has a different and in my opinion better approach to styling and design where you can make it look however you want just like with regular css, just faster. Where on the otherhand Bootstrap is made to look a certain way and is very opinionated.

## Framer Motion

Framer Motion is a library for animation in React. I have had a lot of experience with Framer Motion as well, it is easy to set up utility animations that takes a few arguments like delay and duration, and then use them across the app easily. Out of all the different ways i've tried to animate, this is by far the easiest one.

<br>

## React Icons

React-icons is a small library that helps you add icons (from all different icon libraries) I chose to use this library because it is easy to use as i have used it before and it has a lot of different icon libraries to choose from.

<br>

## React Router

React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. I chose to use React Router because it is easy to use and it is by far the most popular library for routing in React, and it is also the one i have the most experience with and use in every single project of mine.
